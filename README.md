# Go Challenge

## Purpose

Investigate reducing the churn to local code challenge development. Serve as a proving-grounds for what would enable building a skeleton towards iterative code challenge execution. 

## Goals
- Generation of a skeleton
    - Do we need a global directory or can we focus on single directory skeletons?
